# Unexpected Negative Results from Subtraction in JavaScript
This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, behavior of JavaScript's subtraction operator.  When a smaller number is subtracted from a larger number, the result will be negative. This is standard mathematical behavior, but it can be unexpected if not accounted for.

The `bug.js` file shows the issue, and `bugSolution.js` offers potential solutions to handling the scenario where negative results are not desirable.
